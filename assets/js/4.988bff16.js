And the establishment of a unified multilingual and cross-domain translation model is one of the ultimate goals of machine translation research. mRASP, which is in line with the language genius Yuen Ren Chao, has established a successful path from multilingual pre-training to fine-tuning to multiple machine translation models, which will also become a new paradigm of machine translation. ByteDance has applied this technology to the Volctrans system and you can try it in the web page attached at the end of the text. We are looking forward to the continuous emergence of new methods in this direction, making great strides towards the ultimate machine translation goal.
